# Why CSS GRid is hard to learn
CSS Grid can be difficult to learn for several reasons:

1. New layout system: Grid is a new layout system and different from traditional layout methods (such as using tables or floats)

2. Complex syntax: Grid has a complex syntax and uses terms such as grid-template-areas, grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns, grid-row, grid-column, etc.

3. Browser compatibility: Grid is still not fully supported by all browsers and may require additional CSS or JavaScript for compatibility with older browsers.

4. Debugging: Debugging grid layouts can be challenging, as it's not always straightforward to see where elements are positioned in the grid.

5. Flexibility: Grid offers a lot of flexibility, but it can be overwhelming to understand all the different ways to use it.


Even though Flex is better than Grid to understa,apply in real world but in some scenarios Grid is must , some situations like 
1. Two-dimensional layout: Grid is better suited for creating two-dimensional layouts with rows and columns, while flexbox is better suited for one-dimensional layouts.
2. Complex grids: If you need to create a complex grid system with precise control over the placement of elements, Grid is a better choice.
3. Equal-sized elements: If you need to create a grid of equal-sized elements, Grid is easier to use than flexbox.
4. Aligning items along both axes: Grid allows you to align items both vertically and horizontally, while flexbox only allows you to align items along one axis (horizontally or vertically).
5. Layout reordering: Grid allows you to easily change the order of elements in the grid, while flexbox requires additional CSS or JavaScript to achieve the same result.
6. Dynamic grid: If you need to create a grid that can change dynamically based on the available space, Grid may be a better option.
